# Personal Growth App

The application is intended for people who want to take care of their personal development and control their monthly learning and development progress. In the MVP version, the application will allow user login and registration, adding categories to which we want to add completed goals. After a month, the user is able to see a summary of his progress. In the future I anticipate, for example, adding notes to each activity, sharing achievements notifications with friends
